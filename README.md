# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Pocket Network is the TCP/IP of Web3 node infrastructure â€“ a multi-chain relay protocol that incentivizes RPC nodes to provide DApps and their users with unstoppable Web3 access.

[Pocket supports dozens of blockchains](/supported-blockchains)

## Get Started

### Use Pocket Network's RPC

Using Pocket Network is as easy as any other RPC. If you're already using a centralized RPC provider, the [Pocket Portal](https://portal.pokt.network) was built to allow a seamless transition with URLs you can claim below. Alternatively, you can integrate directly with [PocketJS](https://docs.pokt.network/js/).

Get a public RPC URL for your wallet:

{% content-ref url="resources/public-rpc-endpoints" %}
[public-rpc-endpoints](resources/public-rpc-endpoints)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Create a private RPC URL for your DApp:

{% content-ref url="paths/app-developer/" %}
[app-developer](paths/app-developer/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Stake a POKT Node

Learn the basics of staking POKT:

{% content-ref url="buy-store-and-stake-pokt.md" %}
[buy-store-and-stake-pokt.md](buy-store-and-stake-pokt.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Learn how to run your own node:

{% content-ref url="paths/node-runner/" %}
[node-runner](paths/node-runner/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Shape Pocket Network's Future&#x20;

Learn how to contribute to the Pocket Network ecosystem:

{% content-ref url="paths/contributor.md" %}
[contributor.md](paths/contributor.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Learn how to become a member of the DAO:

{% content-ref url="paths/governor/" %}
[governor](paths/governor/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
