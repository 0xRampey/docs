## Steps to Find What You're Looking For

1. **Search the docs.** If it's a common question we probably already answer it here or in the other docs: [Pocket Core](https://docs.pokt.network/core), [PocketJS](https://docs.pokt.network/js).
2. **Search the** [**forum**](https://forum.pokt.network)**.** If it's not in the docs yet, there's a good chance someone already asked in the forum.
3. **Ask in the forum.** If no one else has asked, use the [Support Request category](https://forum.pokt.network/c/help/support-requests/54) to ask for help. We automatically forward all requests to Discord, so don't worry about people noticing it.
4. **Ask in** [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/uCZZkHTQjV)**.** Only once you've done the above steps should you ask your question in Discord.
