## Get Started

### Use Pocket Network's RPC

Using Pocket Network is as easy as any other RPC. If you're already using a centralized RPC provider, the [Pocket Portal](https://portal.pokt.network) was built to allow a seamless transition with URLs you can claim below. Alternatively, you can integrate directly with [PocketJS](https://docs.pokt.network/js/).
