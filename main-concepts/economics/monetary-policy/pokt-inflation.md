# ðŸ“ˆ POKT Inflation

Rewards per Relay (in POKT) will decrease at the discretion of the DAO; therefore, it's only possible to speculate on the inflation schedule. Below are two examples of general approaches that the DAO could elect to use. [Other approaches are also being debated on the forum](https://forum.pokt.network/t/pup-11-wagmi-inflation/1369/55).

### The Milestone Approach

One approach the DAO could consider is decreasing the Rewards per Relay on a tiered basis as the total supply of POKT reaches predetermined milestones. For example, at launch, the total reward per Relay will be 0.01 POKT. Once the total supply of POKT reaches 1 billion POKT, the reward per Relay could drop to 0.001. Once the total supply reaches 2 billion POKT the reward per Relay could then drop to 0.0001. From then on, the reward per Relay will remain at 0.0001 POKT unless adjusted in accordance with Pocketâ€™s governance mechanisms.&#x20;

### The Active Management Approach

Rather than using arbitrary milestones, the DAO could monitor the number of relays and minted POKT in circulation and attempt to encourage or discourage growth depending upon its objectives. For example, in the vote for [PUP-4](https://forum.pokt.network/t/pup-4-adjust-daoallocation-to-limit-service-node-counts/683/), the DAO acted to control the overall number of nodes through economic mechanisms by allocating more of the block reward to the DAO as node counts increased. While this is a temporary measure, it illustrates the DAO's approach to monetary policy.
