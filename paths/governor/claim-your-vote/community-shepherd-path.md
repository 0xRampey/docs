‚ÄúDe lo mio‚Äù, Shepherd. In our homeland, this term of endearment means ‚Äúone of mine‚Äù. Because you have made it here, we consider you to be one of our closest allies in a mission yet unfulfilled. But there is little time for frivolities, the enemy has expanded into the farthest reaches of Web3 and we must continue to cultivate the lands upon which our node and dev allies will fight them.
