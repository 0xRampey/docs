# ðŸ’° PEP â€“ Pocket Ecosystem Proposal

**Pocket Ecosystem Proposals \(PEPs\)** include proposals to distribute funds to or form agreements with Contributors to the Pocket Network ecosystem, in the form of:

* **Imbursements** â€“ payments for future work
* **Reimbursements** â€“ compensation for previous work
* **Bounties** â€“ rewards for work that donâ€™t yet have specified workers
* **Transfers** â€“ transferring funds between DAO-owned accounts
* **Agreements** â€“ forming new DAO relationships, including non-financial in nature

### How is the DAO funded?

The DAO earns continuous revenue in the form of the [DAOAllocation](../../../resources/references/protocol-parameters.md#daoallocation), which is a % that the DAO receives for every [RelaysToTokensMultiplier](../../../resources/references/protocol-parameters.md#relaystotokensmultiplier) minted in the block reward. This is proportional to the number of relays being processed for app developers, which means the more traction Pocket Network gets, the more wealthy the DAO becomes!

PEP votes will last 7 days and pass with Majority Approval \(50% yes votes by participating voters\) unless otherwise specified in the Constitution.
