# ðŸ“¥ Submit a Proposal

Submitting proposals to the DAO is pretty easy and anyone can do it.

There are 3 types of proposals. The easiest way to submit a proposal is to head to the forum category for the proposal \(linked\), then click New Topic to generate a template for your proposal.

{% page-ref page="pip-pocket-improvement-proposal.md" %}

{% page-ref page="pep-pocket-ecosystem-proposal.md" %}

{% page-ref page="pup-parameter-update-proposal.md" %}

Posting your proposal to Discourse puts it up for consideration and debate by the DAO. To kickstart a vote, you need a voter to submit it to our [governance dashboard](https://gov.pokt.network) on your behalf.
