# 🗳 Claim Your Vote

We’ve worked hard to make claiming a vote in our DAO as frictionless as possible for engaged community members, while ensuring that our DAO's voters are knowledgeable and experienced.

The steps for obtaining a vote are as follows...

## 1. Get Qualified

First you need to prove your knowledge of and participation in the Pocket Network by playing 👾POKT Arcade.

There are four paths that you can take on this journey. To get started, you will need to opt into one of the paths by clicking the emojis in the [👋welcome](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/727350500001054730) channel:

* 🧑‍💻**App Developer:** Developer → Netizen  → Savant → Cyberpunk
* 🤖**Node Runner:** Node  → Nodégé → Nodemad → Node Runner
* 🧙**Community Shepherd:** Farmhand → Farmer  → Shepherd → Regen
* 🦾**DAOist:** DAOist → Biohacker  → Cyborg → Singularity

You will complete a series of quests and report your completion of these quests in the [🏆achievement-unlocked](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/763504639299289138) channel in Discord. Read the channels you've unlocked in the 👾Arcade section of Discord to see which quests are up next and how many you need to evolve.

Once you have evolved to the 3rd level of any path, you have qualified for a vote in the DAO. Type `!qualify` in [🏰dao-hq](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/735829050240532561).

## 2. Get Verified

You also need to prove that you are a unique human being by verifying with BrightID. 

{% hint style="info" %}
You don’t need to wait until getting Qualified to do this, these can and should be done in parallel.
{% endhint %}

1. Download the BrightID app on the [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brightid/id1428946820) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.brightid) app stores and connect with Pocket Network community members until the app says you're Verified
2. Get sponsored by [1Hive](https://faucet.1hive.org/#/) \(we’re working on becoming a sponsor soon\)
3. Link your Discord account to your BrightID account by typing `!verify` in [🏰dao-hq](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/735829050240532561), following the instructions sent to you by the BrightID Discord bot, then typing `!me` in [🏰dao-hq](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/735829050240532561)

{% hint style="info" %}
BrightID doesn’t record or store your personal data. It is a social identity network that measures the likelihood that someone has duplicate accounts through the creation and analysis of the social graph. Read the [whitepaper](https://www.brightid.org/whitepaper) for more details.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Claim Your Vote

Type `!claim-vote` in [🏰dao-hq](https://discord.com/channels/553741558869131266/735829050240532561). This will only work if you got both Qualified and Verified.

Then, in 💸vote-airdrop, type `!airdrop`. 

A bot called called Collab.Land will DM you with a link. Follow this link then sign in using your MetaMask wallet. Collab.Land will then airdrop you the POKTDAO token that represents your vote.

{% hint style="info" %}
The token is non-transferable so you should choose a wallet that you're happy holding the token in forever.
{% endhint %}

## 4. Vote and Subscribe

1. Vote in our [governance dashboard](https://gov.pokt.network/) by connecting the wallet you chose for your POKTDAO airdrop.
2. Subscribe to 📥proposals \(click Follow\) and click the 🦾DAOist emoji in 👋welcome to make sure you don't miss anything!
