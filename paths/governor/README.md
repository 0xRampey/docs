# ðŸ‘‘ Governor

Pocket uses off-chain governance, because itâ€™s the most flexible and future-proof way for us to organize our DAO. For more on our reasoning behind this, check out our [Lean Governance Thesis](https://github.com/pokt-network/governance/blob/master/constitution/The%20Lean%20Governance%20Thesis.pdf).

You donâ€™t need a vote in the DAO to submit proposals or participate in discussions! Everyone is free to share their opinions. Head over to [the forum](https://forum.pokt.network/c/governance) to see what decisions are being debated.

To learn how to submit a proposal to the DAO, go here:

All approved decisions get submitted to the blockchain by the Pocket Network Foundation, which is fully accountable to the DAO. To learn more about how this is, read the [DAO Constitution](https://github.com/pokt-foundation/governance/blob/master/constitution/constitution.md) and the Foundation's [Articles of Association](https://github.com/pokt-foundation/governance/blob/master/foundation/Pocket-Network-Foundation-Articles-of-Association-Highlighted.pdf).
