# ðŸ“¥ Submit a Proposal

Submitting proposals to the DAO is pretty easy and anyone can do it.

There are 3 types of proposals. The easiest way to submit a proposal is to head to the forum category for the proposal \(linked\), then click New Topic to generate a template for your proposal.

* \*\*\*\*[**Improvements \(PIPs\)**](https://forum.pokt.network/c/governance/pip/28)**:** governance and protocol upgrades
* \*\*\*\*[**Ecosystem Grants \(PEPs\)**](https://forum.pokt.network/c/governance/pep/29)**:** spending the DAO treasury on ecosystem developments \(e.g. community-maintained tooling\)
* \*\*\*\*[**Parameter Updates \(PUPs\)**](https://forum.pokt.network/c/governance/pup/30)**:** changing the value of a parameter \(all parameters and current values are listed [here](../../resources/references/protocol-parameters.md)\)

Posting your proposal to Discourse puts it up for consideration and debate by the DAO. To kickstart a vote, you need a voter to submit it to our [governance dashboard](https://gov.pokt.network) on your behalf.
