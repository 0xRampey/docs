# ðŸ§™ Shepherd

You don't need to develop an app or run a node to contribute to the Pocket Network ecosystem! 

In fact, Shepherds can even earn a vote in the DAO by doing things like:

* Using Pocket in their DApps \([Conscious DAppitalism](conscious-dappitalism.md)\)
* Creating meaningful content
* Organizing and attending meetups and workshops
* Mentoring other community members
