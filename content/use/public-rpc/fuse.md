description: Add the FUSE network in MetaMask using a Pocket-powered RPC endpoint.
---


{{< youtube  >}}
We have created a public Fuse RPC endpoint with up to 3M requests per day to give people who use Metamask the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infra.

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for Fuse, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC
2. Under the Network Name field, write **Fuse Pocket Portal**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://fuse-rpc.gateway.pokt.network/`
4. Put the hexadecimal **0x7a** in the ChainID field
5. Write **FUSE** as the Symbol
6. Add `https://explorer.fuse.io` as the Block Explorer URL
7. Donâ€™t forget to save
