description: Add the Evmos network in MetaMask using a Pocket-powered RPC endpoint.
---


We have minted a public Evmos RPC endpoint to give people who use Metamask the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infrastructure.

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for Evmos, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC.
2. Under the Network Name field, write **Evmos Pocket Portal**.
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://evmos-rpc.gateway.pokt.network`.
4. Put the decimal **9001** in the ChainID field.
5. Write **EVMOS** as the Symbol.
6. Add `https://evm.evmos.org/` as the Block Explorer URL.
7. Don't forget to save.
