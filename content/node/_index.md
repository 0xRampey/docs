In this section, you'll get information on running a Pocket node.

These details are mostly for "intermediate" node runners, who are familiar with running full nodes and have the knowledge required to avoid getting lost. If you would like a more beginner's tutorial, visit [Zero To Node](tutorials/zero-to-node/README.md). You may also want to explore [node-hosting services]({{< relref "hosting-services" >}}).

Want to understand the economics of running a node before you dive in? Read about [Node Economics]({{< relref "../learn/economics/nodes" >}}).

Read our guide to decide whether you want your nodes to be operated with [custodial staking or non-custodial staking]({{< relref "staking" >}}).

For a no-frills guide to commands, you should head over to the [Pocket Core docs](https://docs.pokt.network/core/).
