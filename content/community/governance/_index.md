description: Learn about the Pocket DAO and how proposals are created and managed.
---


Pocket Network is a pioneer in a new era of democratically-governed digital public goods. Our Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) means that you, our community, will control all aspects of our protocol and ecosystem.

Pocket uses off-chain governance because it’s the most flexible and future-proof way for us to organize our DAO. For more on our reasoning behind this, check out our [Lean Governance Thesis](https://github.com/pokt-network/governance/blob/master/constitution/The%20Lean%20Governance%20Thesis.pdf).

To learn how to earn a vote in the DAO and decide the future of Pocket Network, [see the section on trophies](/community/trophies/).

You don’t need a vote in the DAO to submit proposals or participate in discussions! Everyone is free to share their opinions. Head over to [the forum](https://forum.pokt.network/c/governance) to see what decisions are being debated.

To learn how to submit a proposal to the DAO, [see the section on proposals](/community/governance/proposals/).

All approved decisions get submitted to the blockchain by the Pocket Network Foundation, which is fully accountable to the DAO. To learn more about how this is, read the [DAO Constitution](https://github.com/pokt-foundation/governance/blob/master/constitution/constitution.md) and the Foundation's [Articles of Association](https://github.com/pokt-foundation/governance/blob/master/foundation/PNF%20Articles%20Jan-2023%20Highlighted.pdf).
