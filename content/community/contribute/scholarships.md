## Recipients

### April 2023

Jamie Law (aka [@lawjammed](https://twitter.com/lawjammed)) is the second recipient of the Pocket Scholarship for his research work on `Exploring the mobilization of decentralised groups: governance and community organization within DAOs.`

He was awarded a total of 90,000 POKT for [his proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CksoH8gCgDy-2KCRlX-dgP9n3j2hIsHAo-koNHN65mU/edit) to study Pocket Network as the foudnation for gaining both theoretical and practical insight into how DAOs operate. The live research thread can be found [here](https://forum.pokt.network/t/build-lawjammed-dissertation-research-thread/4379) and the original proposal can be summarized as follows:


> I am completing a 15,000-word dissertation for an MSc in Entrepreneurship and Innovation from Edinburgh University. I want to explore how Pocket aligns goals, including the importance of openness, trust, cooperation, and data sharing in promoting innovation. I'd also like to examine the changing role of leadership and the significance of modularity, flexibility, and adaptability as the DAO matures. To do this, I'd study Pocket’s governance structure, conceptualisation, incentives, decision rights, and accountability.
> 
> At a high level, the dissertation will attempt to bridge the gap between work on DAOs and work on polycentric governance. Most existing literature on DAOs is hypothetical (just talking about them in theory) or the examples are dated. For example, there’s no academic literature (that I’ve found) on proof-of-participation governance models. To remedy this, the dissertation would look at Pocket as a case study. Over the summer, I’d interview people in the community, analyse Pocket’s online material, and bring in relevant academic literature to develop the thesis.


### June 2022

Tyler Kell ([@relyt29](https://twitter.com/relyt29)) is the first recipient of the Pocket Scholarship for his presentation `Academic Cryptocurrency Research Space - An Overview, Spring 2022` at [Infracon](https://www.infracon.org/) 2022 - Pocket's inaugral conference.
