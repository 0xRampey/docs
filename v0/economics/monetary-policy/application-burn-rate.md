# ðŸ”¥ Application Burn Rate

To ensure the continued sustainability of POKT, reasonable margins for Service Nodes, and to eliminate unnecessary overinflation of POKT, the Pocket DAO will activate the Application Burn Rate \(ABR\) at the Maturity Phase. Any POKT minting is balanced out by Application stake being burned at the same rate. Once activated, the ABR results in a shift from Applications paying through dilution, to Application POKT being burned on a block by block basis to balance the minting of POKT as inflation awards to Service Nodes.  

The effect of this is a logarithmic decay until the minimum App stake of 1 POKT is reached. Unless an Application increases the number of POKT they have staked, their holdings will fall under their desired amount causing applications to "top up" their stakes turning the network into a self-sustaining SaaS-like infrastructure protocol.

The rate of Application burn is determined by using indicators such as the decay in the growth of Application and Service Node stake over time.
