# xDAI MetaMask

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/9nfL7l6YtkU" %}

We have minted a public xDAI RPC endpoint with up to 1M requests per day to give people who use Metamask the opportunity to connect to Pocket's decentralized, censorship-resistant infra.

To get started connecting to Pocket's infrastructure for xDAI, do the following:

1. Click on the Networks drop-down menu, then press Custom RPC
2. Under the Network Name field, write **xDAI Pocket Portal**
3. Within the New RPC URL field, copy and paste this endpoint URL `https://xdai-rpc.gateway.pokt.network`
4. Put the hexadecimal **0x64** in the ChainID field
5. Write **XDAI** as the Symbol
6. Add `https://blockscout.com/poa/xdai` as the Block Explorer URL
7. Donâ€™t forget to save
