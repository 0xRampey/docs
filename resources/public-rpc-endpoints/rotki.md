  application

# Rotki

[Rotki](https://bit.ly/RotkiPOKT) is an open-source portfolio tracker and accounting/analytics tool that protects your privacy.

We've sponsored a public Ethereum RPC endpoint for Rotki users in order to add an extra layer of privacy when using the application.&#x20;

To get started connecting to Pocket's censorship-resistant infrastructure for Ethereum, do the following:

1\. Open and login into your local application.
